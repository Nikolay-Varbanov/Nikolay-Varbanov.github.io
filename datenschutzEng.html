		<h2 id="m27">Safety measures</h2>
		
		<p>
			We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the type, scope, circumstances and purposes of the processing as well as the different probabilities of occurrence and the extent of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.
		</p>

		<p>
			The measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as the access, input, disclosure, ensuring availability and its separation. We have also set up procedures to ensure that the rights of those affected are exercised, data are deleted and responses are made to data threats. We also take the protection of personal data into account when developing or selecting hardware, software and procedures in accordance with the principle of data protection, through technology design and through data protection-friendly default settings.
		</p>


		<h2 id="m25">Transfer of personal data</h2>

The recipients of this data can include: B. include service providers commissioned with IT tasks or providers of services and content that are integrated into a website.

		<h2 id="m10">Rights of data subjects</h2>

		<h2 id="m134">Use of cookies</h2>
		
		<p>
			Cookies are small text files or other storage notes that store information on end devices and read information from the end devices. For example, to save the login status in a user account, the contents of a shopping cart in an e-shop, the content accessed or the functions used of an online offer. Cookies can also be used for various purposes, e.g. for the purposes of the functionality, security and comfort of online offerings as well as the creation of analyzes of visitor flows.
		</p>
		
		<p>
				<strong>
					Notes on consent: 
				</strong>
			We use cookies in accordance with legal regulations. We therefore obtain prior consent from users, unless this is not required by law. In particular, consent is not necessary if the storage and reading of the information, including cookies, is absolutely necessary in order to provide users with a telemedia service they have expressly requested (i.e. our online offering). Strictly necessary cookies generally include cookies with functions related to the display and operability of the online offering, load balancing, security, storage of users' preferences and choices or similar to the provision of the main and secondary functions of those requested by users purposes related to the online offering. The revocable consent is clearly communicated to the users and contains information on the respective cookie use.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<strong>
				Information on data protection legal bases: 
			</strong>
			The data protection legal basis on which we process users' personal data using cookies depends on whether we ask users for consent. If users consent, the legal basis for processing your data is their declared consent. Otherwise, the data processed using cookies will be processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g. in the commercial operation of our online offering and improving its usability) or, if this is within the scope of the fulfillment of our contractual obligations, if the use of cookies is necessary for our purposes to fulfill contractual obligations. We will explain the purposes for which we process cookies in the course of this data protection declaration or as part of our consent and processing processes.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<strong>
				Storage period: 
			</strong>
			With regard to the storage period, the following types of cookies are distinguished:
		</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>
					Temporary cookies (also: session or session cookies):
				</strong>
			 Temporary cookies are deleted at the latest after a user has left an online offer and closed their device (e.g. browser or mobile application).
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>
					Permanent cookies:
				</strong> 
				Permanent cookies remain stored even after the device is closed. For example, the login status can be saved or preferred content can be displayed directly when the user visits a website again. User data collected using cookies can also be used to measure reach. Unless we provide users with explicit information about the type and storage period of cookies (e.g. when obtaining consent), users should assume that cookies are permanent and that the storage period can be up to two years.
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>
			<strong>
				General information on revocation and objection (so-called “opt-out”):
			</strong>
				Users can revoke the consent they have given at any time and object to the processing in accordance with legal requirements. To do this, users can, among other things, restrict the use of cookies in their browser settings (which may also limit the functionality of our online offering). You can also object to the use of cookies for online marketing purposes via the websites

				Processing of cookie data based on consent:

The declaration of consent is saved so that it does not have to be asked again and to be able to prove consent in accordance with the legal obligation.

	<h2 id="m317">Business benefits</h2>
	
	<p>
		We process data from our contractual and business partners, e.g. customers and interested parties (collectively referred to as “contractual partners”) within the framework of contractual and comparable legal relationships as well as associated measures and as part of communication with the contractual partners (or pre-contractual), e.g. to respond to inquiries answer.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		We process this data to fulfill our contractual obligations. This includes, in particular, the obligations to provide the agreed services, any update obligations and remedies in the event of warranty and other service disruptions. In addition, we process the data to protect our rights and for the purposes of the administrative tasks associated with these obligations and the company organization. In addition, we process the data on the basis of our legitimate interests in proper and business management as well as security measures to protect our contractual partners and our business operations from misuse and jeopardy of their data, secrets, information and rights (e.g. for the participation of telecommunications, transport and other auxiliary services as well as subcontractors, banks, tax and legal advisors, payment service providers or tax authorities). Within the scope of applicable law, we only pass on the data of contractual partners to third parties to the extent that this is necessary for the aforementioned purposes or to fulfill legal obligations. The contractual partners will be informed about other forms of processing, e.g. for marketing purposes, as part of this data protection declaration.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		We inform the contractual partners which data is required for the aforementioned purposes before or as part of the data collection, e.g. in online forms, through special marking (e.g. colors) or symbols (e.g. asterisks, etc.), or in person.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		We delete the data after the expiry of statutory warranty and comparable obligations, i.e. generally after 4 years, unless the data is stored in a customer account, e.g. as long as it must be retained for legal archiving reasons. The statutory retention period is ten years for documents relevant to tax law as well as for commercial books, inventories, opening balance sheets, annual financial statements, the work instructions required to understand these documents and other organizational documents and accounting documents, and six years for commercial and business letters received and copies of the commercial and business letters sent. The period begins at the end of the calendar year in which the last entry was made in the book, the inventory, the opening balance sheet, the annual financial statements or the management report were prepared, the commercial or business letter was received or sent or the accounting document was created and the recording was also made has been made or the other documents have been created.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		To the extent that we use third-party providers or platforms to provide our services, the terms and conditions and data protection notices of the respective third-party providers or platforms apply in the relationship between the users and the providers.
