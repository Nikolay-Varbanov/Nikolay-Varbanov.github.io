<u>Liability for content</u><br><br>

<p>All content on our website was created with the greatest care and to the best of our knowledge. However, we cannot guarantee that the content is correct, complete or up-to-date. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with general laws in accordance with Section 7 Paragraph 1 TMG. However, according to Sections 8 to 10 TMG, as a service provider we are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information in accordance with general law remain unaffected.</p>

<p>However, liability in this regard is only possible from the time we become aware of a specific legal violation. If we become aware of the above-mentioned legal violations, we will immediately remove this content.</p>

<u>Limitation of liability for external links</u>

<p>Our website contains links to external third-party websites. We have no influence on the content of these directly or indirectly linked websites. We therefore cannot assume any liability for the accuracy of the content of “external links”. The respective providers or operators (authors) of the pages are responsible for the content of the external links.</p>

<p> External links were checked for possible legal violations at the time the link was created and were free of illegal content at the time the link was created. A constant check of the content of external links is not possible without concrete evidence of a legal violation. In the case of direct or indirect links to third-party websites that are outside our area of responsibility, liability would only exist if we became aware of the content and it would be technically possible and reasonable for us to prevent use in the event of illegal content .</p>

<p>This disclaimer of liability also applies to links and references from questioners, blog entries and guests of the discussion forum within the “name of your domain” website. The service provider of the page to which reference is made is solely liable for illegal, incorrect or incomplete content and in particular for damage resulting from the use or non-use of such information, not the person who merely refers to the respective publication via links.</p>

<p>If we become aware of legal violations, we will immediately remove the external links.</p>
